Today is my first journal entry. I am planning to occasionally write something here (every month at least once I guess) for my next 3 years in University. Just for fun, reflecting in the future and maybe influencing others.
</p>

<p>
As for this day I'm basically done with high school. I completed my last exam that was about computer science yesterday with the top grade :). It was a spoken exam but I'd say that spoken computer science finals are harder than written ones at least for me since I'm not a talker. The guy before me even failed lol. I couldn't really believe it that he failed as I think that our teacher explained every topic except programming really good. Can be that programming is hard to teach, or that you need to be passionate enough for it or even both.
</p>

<p>
For school I can say that I'm glad that I'm done with it. Didn't really have real friends there and when you know what you want to do in the future your motivation starts dwindling down.
</p>

<p>
I still need to wait until Friday the 18. June to get my documents to officially graduate.

Might be a bit late on the update on the 18. June. So our area seems to be the last one to hand out the documents to graduate. I heard that one of my childhood friends got theirs like 2 weeks earlier.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I'd like to complain about is that universities want a verified copy of the documents and my school only gave me one. I can only guess that you need to pay to get more. It shouldn't be a huge problem as the people I asked about this said that I don't need to worry too much especially with my grades. They also got in their desired university as well even though some had worse grades than me.
</p>

<p>
My overall score is one grade below top grade a 2,1. 4.0 is the worst passable score and 1.0 is the best that only one boy in my school got - I really hope that he becomes influential one day. He got prizes from biology, chemistry, physics and math organizations. He didn't have computer science but I don't even know if there is a prize for computer science because I didn't get one even though I technically have top score in it and I also was the best in my entire grade. I am talking about technically because the best grade is 15 and the worst is 0 and I got a 13 which still counts as top grade. The scores that I mentioned earlier are calculated from the other scoring system that goes from 15 to 0. Funny.
</p>

<p>
The next entry will probably be about me visiting some childhood friends. Hope that they still live where I expect them to be.
