Today is my first journal entry. I am planning to occasionally write something here (every month at least once I guess) for my next 3 years in University. Just for fun, reflecting in the future and maybe influencing others.
</p>

<p>
As for this day I'm basically done with highschool. I completed my last exam that was about computer science yesterday with the top grade :). It was a spoken exam but I'd say that spoken computer science finals are harder than written ones at least for me since I'm not a talker. The guy before me even failed lol. I couldn't really believe it that he failed as I think that our teacher explained every topic except programming really good. Can be that programming is hard to teach, or that you need to be passionate enough for it or even both.
</p>

<p>
For school I can say that I'm glad that I'm done with it. Didn't really have real friends there and when you know what you want to do in the future your motivation starts dwindling down.
</p>

<p>
I still need to wait until friday the 18. June to get my documents to oficially graduate.
