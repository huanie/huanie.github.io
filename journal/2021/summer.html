Today is my first journal entry. I am planning to occasionally write something here (every month at least once I guess) for my next 3 years in University. Just for fun, reflecting in the future and maybe influencing others.
</p>

<p>
As for this day I am basically done with high school. I completed my last exam that was about computer science yesterday with the top grade :). It was a spoken exam but I would say that spoken computer science finals are harder than written ones at least for me since I am not a talker. The guy before me even failed lol. I could not really believe it that he failed as I think that our teacher explained every topic except programming really good. Can be that programming is hard to teach, or that you need to be passionate enough for it or even both.
</p>

<p>
For school I can say that I am glad that I am done with it. Did not really have real friends there and when you know what you want to do in the future your motivation starts dwindling down.
</p>

<p>
I still need to wait until Friday the 18. June to get my documents to officially

Might be a bit late on the update on the 18. June. So our area seems to be the last one to hand out the documents to graduate. I heard that one of my childhood friends got theirs like 2 weeks earlier.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I would like to complain about is that universities want a verified copy of the documents and my school only gave me one. I can only guess that you need to pay to get more. It should not be a huge problem as the people I asked about this said that I do not need to worry too much especially with my grades. They also got in their desired university as well even though some had worse grades than me.
</p>

<p>
My overall score is one grade below top grade a 2,1. 4.0 is the worst passable score and 1.0 is the best that only one boy in my school got - I really hope that he will accomplish something. He got prizes from biology, chemistry, physics and math organizations. He did not have computer science but I do not even know if there is a prize for computer science because I did not get one even though I technically have top score in it and I also was the best in my entire grade. I am talking about technically because the best grade is 15 and the worst is 0 and I got a 13 which still counts as top grade. The scores that I mentioned earlier are calculated from the other scoring system that goes from 15 to 0. Funny.
</p>

<p>
The next entry will probably be about me visiting some childhood friends. Hope that they still live where I expect them to be.

I had some medical exams on the 24. June. One to check my eye sight because I am nearsighted. The other one to get some blood samples of me. As for the eyes, the doctor said that I am always going to be nearsighted. I really want to get rid of my glasses though because they make me look worse so I am considering to get contact lenses. No idea I am poor.

The visit that I mentioned last entry was very nice. Kinda funny to see someone from your childhood after 8 years again. I could not even recognize her and she could not recognize me. We took a walk for about 1 hour and talked about all sorts of random things. Sadly it was only her that was there. The others moved out and I do not have their phone numbers because back then when I was moving I had no phone - nobody had. About phone numbers, I forgot to ask for her telephone number or about any other way to contact her. Could be nice to meet her again. Maybe next time.

Shit day. I decided on a whim to go visit childhood friends again. I got the telephone number from the girl last time but the person I wanted to go to moved away. I basically wasted my time from 12am to 6pm. sigh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I feel terrible.

Man I am so unlucky. My doctor called me yesterday to tell me today that my hepatitis B got worse. I need to take pills everyday now and I need to vaccinate myself against COVID.
</p>

<p>
Not only that but my parents do not want me to go to my 1st choice university. My father wants to drive 900 km to visit that place now. Maybe my vaccination appointment on Saturday will save me from this.
